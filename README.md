# FineTuning
Me learning how to fine tune models, doing a couple goofy projects and recording them here as a kind of study log.



### 6/4/24 
playing around with the transformer library, loading in models from huggingface and building them manually/ getting the tokenizer and models and saving them seperately. Pipeline is pretty convenient

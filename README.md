# FineTuning
Me learning how to fine tune models, doing a couple goofy projects and recording them here as a kind of study log.

Fine-tuned a BERT model to classify IMDB reviews as positive or negative following a HF guide. The process was a lot more straightforward that I had expected.

playing around with the transformer library, loading in models from huggingface and building them manually/ getting the tokenizer and models and saving them seperately. Pipeline is pretty convenient
